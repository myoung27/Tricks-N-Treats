# Tricks-N-Treats

Project #2 for WDI18 at General Assembly

## Overview

Every year, thousands of kids go Trick-or-Treating. As the years progress, people move, decorations change, and no one is really keeping track of whats going on. This is where Tricks-N-Treats comes in. Trick-N-Treats is an app designed for parents and kids to plan for Halloween. Think of it as a bookmark, to what everyone gave last year in your community and plan around it. You have the ability to choose from available neighborhoods, and add Houses with pictures and comments to keep track of what each house gives. If you don't see your neighborhood, you more than welcome create your own and build up you're own neighborhood!
